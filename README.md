# Social Media and Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between social media usage, lifestyle habits, and mental health using a dataset of 5,000 individuals. The dataset contains 15 columns, including demographic attributes, screen-time behavior, interaction types, sleep duration, physical activity levels, and a labeled mental state (`Healthy`, `Stressed`, or `At_Risk`). 

The focus of this project is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, using Python libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to uncover patterns and insights.

## Key Features
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Social media platform usage and screen-time behavior
- Hours of sleep and physical activity levels
- Labeled mental state for each individual

## Objective
- Explore how hours spent on social media and a particular platform correlate with mental health
- Visualize distributions, trends, and relationships between features
- Practice **data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization** using Python

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Visualizations
- Bar charts showing the distribution of mental states
- Scatter plots of hours spent on social media vs hours of sleep, colored by mental state
- Boxplots and correlation heatmaps to explore feature relationships
